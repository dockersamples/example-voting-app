# NOTES
# You will need 4 concurrent pipelines to allow this to run as fast as possible
# Please generate an API Key Codefresh CLI https://g.codefresh.io/account/tokens and store in API_KEY variable
# You need to configure Docker Registry access in Codefresh and set push build step for (3) micro-services to push to that registry by friendly name
# You need to configure Kubernetes with a Pull Secret for the Registry and update variable KUBE_PULL_SECRET with the name you gave the secret
# Pull Secrets explained: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
# You can use your integrated Codefresh Registry for above just follow steps documented here: https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/docker-registries/codefresh-registry/
# Add variable DOCKER_REGISTRY to point to your Docker Repository ex. r.cfcr.io/CF_ACCOUNT/CF_REPOSITORY or r.cfcr.io/perfect_pipeline/codefresh/example-voting-app-worker
# Please make sure to update each pipeline yaml file under result, vote and worker with your correct friendly Docker Registry name See comment inline on those files
# Pipeline IDs for the pipelines for 3 microservices (Shown in curl webhook command on pipeline page in Configuration > General Settings)
# Create KUBE_CONTEXT variables with Codefresh friendly name given to your Kubernetes Cluster
# Create KUBE_NAMESPACE variable with Kubernetes namespace for Release
# TODO Turn into README
